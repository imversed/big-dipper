because of huge memory usage by mteor it could be build in pipeline
before merge in master run several steps

1. yarn clean
2. yarn build // it will build bundle and install internal deps

after commit brang can me merged in master and pipeline will do rest

You also can try, what was buil, local
docker-compose up -d
cd bundle
MONGO_URL=mongodb://localhost:27017/myapp METEOR_SETTINGS=$(cat ../settings-staging.json) ROOT_URL=http://localhost PORT=8080 node main.js
